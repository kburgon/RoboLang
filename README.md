# RoboLang

RoboLang is a simple language meant for teaching how to program a robot.  While future development may make RoboLang a more powerful and useful language, it is currently only being developed to be a simple scripting language that can be used to give a robot basic autonomous functionality.  The first stage will be a language that just prints certain statements to the console and will be further developed into actually controlling boards and electronic conponents.

This project is an interpreter for RoboLang, and will have shell functionality as well as the ability to run a written file.
